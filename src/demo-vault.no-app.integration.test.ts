// Keeps the in-repo `demo-vault/` in sync with the plugin's public surface WITHOUT
// Launching Obsidian: it reflects the real config from source and asserts every
// Setting is documented in a note, and that the guard note/member still exist
// (rename drift). Advanced Debug Mode's runtime behavior (long stack traces, debug
// Mode, long-running-task timeouts) is exercised by the desktop/android integration
// Suites, so here only the PluginSettings config class is reflected.
